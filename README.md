# Nitsche-Boundary-Conditions-for-non-Fourier-Heat-Transport
Non-Fourier heat conduction is a field of complex models describing heat transport in very specific a challenging settings (i.e. extremely small sizes etc.). This project presents a way to model slip boundary conditions for a complex non-Fourier heat conduction model and implements it numerically.
